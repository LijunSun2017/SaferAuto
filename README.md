Detect, locate and track road elements from a video stream using **[YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) real-time object detection system**. Among the elements to classify, the model will be trained to detect traffic lights, vehicles and some types of road signs.

## Key Features
* Detection of speed limit road signs and speed identification.
* Detection of traffic lights and classification depending on its state (green, amber, red). *[on progress]*
* Detection of cars and classification of the type. *[on progress]*
* Detect the previous elements in real-time. *[on progress]*
* Track the previous elements in real-time. *[on progress]* 
* UI that displays the current detection and tracking of the road elements, showing bounding boxes with the different classes. *[on progress]*

## How to use
The current state of SaferAuto is **beta**, for the moment only the model for detecting speed limit road signs has been trained. However, the next feature to release will be a UI to try the detection with a real video stream.
