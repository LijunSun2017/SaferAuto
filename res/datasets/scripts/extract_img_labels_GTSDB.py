# Modification of the GTSRB script [http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset#Structure]

# Python program for converting the ppm files from The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) to jpg files
# in order to use them in YOLO. Besides, it generate a txt with all the paths to the converted images in darknet format.
